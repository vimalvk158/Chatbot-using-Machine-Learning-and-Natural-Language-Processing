This model will consist of three blocks: Sine Wave, Gain, and Scope. The Sine Wave is a Source Block from which a sinusoidal input signal originates. This signal is transferred through a line in the direction indicated by the arrow to the Gain Math Block. The Gain block modifies its input signal (multiplies it by a constant value) and outputs a new signal through a line to the Scope block. The Scope is a Sink Block used to display a signal (much like an oscilloscope). We begin building our system by bringing up a new model window in which to create the blockLet us assume that our system's sinusoidal input has:

Lines are drawn by dragging the mouse from where a signal starts (output terminal of a black) to where it ends (input terminal of another block).
